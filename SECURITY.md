## Responsible Disclosure Security Policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect joodle's users from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and providing an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue.

We kindly ask for you to refrain from malicious acts that put joodle users, any contributors, or the project iself at risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report the issue directly to the project maintainers. Do not use public communication methods (such as IRC or Github issues).

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
