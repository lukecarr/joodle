## Pull Request Process

1. ~~Ensure that your tests are passing and your coverage is high! Run `npm test -- --verbose --coverage` to get a detailed test report; all tests must pass, and your coverage should be 100%!~~ Tests have not yet been implemented.
2. Create an informative PR using one of the provided templates. If you are unsure about anything in the template then raise an issue and tag it with the `meta` label!
3. ~~Wait for the automated tests to complete. These tests are the same as the ones you performed during step 1, but we also run them automatically as well. Better safe than sorry!~~ Tests have not yet been implemented.
4. Wait for approval. Your PR must be approved by a code owner before it can be merged onto the develop branch. If you have not had any response at all (either in the form of the PR being accepted or a code owner commenting with an explanation for denial) after 48 hours then feel free to mention someone directly with `@username`!
